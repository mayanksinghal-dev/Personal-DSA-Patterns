Invariant 1 — “Validity-maintaining window”

    While increasing window, we make sure that window is satisfying the constraints of the problem. If window breaks the constraints,
    we shrink our window. So pointer R only moves when window is constraints passed.

    Typical when: “longest/shortest subarray/substring such that condition holds”.

    Common repair rule: expand r, and while invalid → move l to restore validity.

    Problems (3–4):
    Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (LC 3)
    Max Consecutive Ones III (LC 1004)
    Longest Repeating Character Replacement (LC 424)
    Minimum Window Substring (LC 76) (hard but classic)
    Minimum Size Subarray Sum (LC 209)
    Fruit Into Baskets (LC 904)
    Permutation in String (LC 567)
